Alt-H2 Settings
------
In MSM Server Tools there are multiple settings you can customize, for example, if you want to connect to your own custom server, set the custom server ip to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) or your own server ip, default: `null`.
Or, you can set your port to what your server supports, default: `9933`.
