# Requests
------
My Singing Monsters uses [Smartfox2x](https://www.smartfoxserver.com/products/sfs2x) as their main Client-Server structure, which allows for easy request sending and responding.

In MSM Server Tools, after you [Login](https://github.com/MSM-Server-Tools/blob/main/README.md#login) you are given 4 new elements to play with:

⋅⋅* Request Name (You can find a list of all requests MSM requests and retrieves [here](https://example.com)

⋅⋅* Params

* Test
